We are working on a new jupyter notebook like interface that is AI native.

We are using E2B sandboxes to execute python code.
Sandboxes do not persist between executions.
Due to this we cannot ever split up code execution into multiple steps, and have to keep track of definitions to be reused.

The notebook itself should be represented as a JSON, consisting of cells, cell code, cell outputs, defined variables, defined methods, and imports.
